# Suboptimal_NOMA_5G
The repository contains a research article implementation(reproduced results), in which the authors have proposed a sub optimal scheme for up-link multiple access in 5G systems.
  There is a Octave code file which reproduces results correctly for users > 100, and for users < 100, it deviates from the research article. One can directly run the code in Octave. The code is in the file "project_code.m", and one required function is in the "generateRandCust.m" file, so make sure to add it to the path.
